For some reason, even though I had booked it for morning, the app gave me a confirmation for evening. I contacted Dr. Osama regarding the same and he immediately sorted it out and gave us a morning tour. Muhammad was our guide for the day and he was extremely gracious, forthcoming and knowledagle about the city and it's history. We walked around the town at leisure while he explained the history and significance of the structures and the current restoration work. He also told us about the other places that we could visit in the city. We were looking to buy some perfumes and dates and he was extremely accomodating and took us to 3-4 different shops with a variety of products available. I highly recommend Abha Trips and Muhammad for your next trip to Jeddah if you wish to explore the city and understand it's history and culture. We had a great experience and are extremely happy with the service.",

We were surprised to see a road sign to Roman theater so went to discover and explore. The site is still under construction but gives lovely views across the coastline and hopefully when finished will be a great venue with water in the moat and toilet / refreshments on site. Glad we visited while in the area. No petrol stations, cafes, shops in the area and nearest toilet facilities we found were at the beach so take these into account when visiting the area.",

It can be seen how much money is invested by KSA (the kingdom of Saudi Arabia) for the development of tourism. Gorgeous hotels, restaurants were built in the desert, a concert hall was erected, lined with mirrors at which world -class stars of the Jose Correras -like stars are invited. Flights in balloons, a tour of ruins and tombs (very reminiscent of Peter), phenomenal species. I can’t get to Mecca of the end of the audience, but in any case I recommend. Many changes - not all women are already wearing a veil, the religious police are not so strict. But from the point of view of health, just excellent - complete detox, there is no alcohol anywhere, even in chic hotels :) You get an electronic visa very quickly!",

    "text": "لقد ذكرنا في مقالة سابقة بعنوان \"وثمود الذين جابوا الصخر بالواد\" أن الوصف القرآني لمساكن قوم ثمود أو ما سمي بمدائن صالح جاء مطابقا لما أظهرته الصور المأخوذة من الجوجل إيرث لهذه المساكن. فمدائن صالح كما وصفها القرآن الكريم تقع في واد واسع يمتد من الشمال إلى الجنوب و يبلغ أقصى عرض له ما يقرب من خمسة عشر كيلومتر ثم يضيق وهو يتجه إلى الجنوب إلى أن يصل إلى أقل من كيلومتر عن مدينة العلا التي تقع إلى الجنوب من المدائن على بعد عشرين كيلومتر. ويحيط بهذا الواد سلاسل جبلية شاهقة فالسلسلة الغربية الشمالية من الواد يصل إرتفاعها إلى ألف وخمسمائة متر عن سطح البحر بينما يصل ارتفاع السلسلة الجنوبية الشرقية إلى ألف متر أما ارتفاع أرض الواد المنبسطة فيبلغ ثمانمائة متر عن سطح البحر. وفي هذه المقالة سنقوم بالاستعانة بصور الجوجل إيرث والمواصفات المذكورة في تفاسير القرآن الكريم للصخرة التي خرجت منها الناقة بتحديد مكان هذه الصخرة.\nفقد جاء في تفاس��ر القرآن الكريم من أن الناقة التي أرسلها الله سبحانه وتعالى كآية إلى قوم ثمود قد خرجت من صخرة عظيمة تقع منفلردة في ناحية الحجر. وقد ذكر المفسرون أن ثمود اجتمعوا يوماً في ناديهم فجاءهم رسول الله صالح فدعاهم إلى الله وذكرهم وحذرهم ووعظهم وأمرهم فقالوا له: إن أنت أخرجت لنا من هذه الصخرة - وأشاروا إلى صخرة هناك - ناقة من صفتها كيت وكيت وذكروا أوصافاً سموها ونعتوها وتعنتوا فيها، وأن تكون عشراء، طويلة من صفتها كذا وكذا فقال لهم النبي صالح عليه السلام: أرأيتم إن أجبتكم إلى ما سألتم على الوجه الذي طلبتم أتؤمنون بما جئتكم به وتصدقوني فيما أرسلت به؟ قالوا: نعم. فأخذ عهودهم ومواثيقهم على ذلك. ثم قام إلى مصلاه فصلى لله عز وجل ما قدر له ثم دعا ربه عز وجل أن يجيبهم إلى ما طلبوا فأمر الله عز وجل تلك الصخرة أن تنفطر عن ناقة عظيمة عشراء على الوجه المطلوب الذي طلبوا أو على الصفة التي نعتوا فلما عاينوها كذلك رأوا أمراً عظيماً ومنظراً هائلاً وقدرة باهرة ودليلاً قاطعاً وبرهاناً ساطعاً فآمن كثير منهم واستمر أكثرهم على كفرهم وضلالهم وعنادهم. \nوقد يسأل سائل عن المصدر الذي استقى منه المفسرون هذه الروايات عن مواصفات الصخرة وكذلك الناقة والطريقة التي عقرت بها وحتى أسماء الأشخاص الذين تآمروا على قتلها. والجواب على ذلك أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قد قص على أصحابه كثيرا من تفصيلات قصة صالح عليه السلام مع قومه عند مروره بالحجر في طريقه إلى تبوك وقد حفظها من حفظها ونسيها من نسيها. فقد روى أبو الزبير عن جابر قال : لما نزلنا الحجر فغزا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم تبوك ، قال : « أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ لاَ تَسْأَلُوا عَن هَذِهِ الآياتِ [ هؤلاء ] قَوْمُ صَالِحٍ سَأَلُوا نَبِيَّهُم أَن يَبْعَثَ اللَّهُ لَهُم آيَةً ، فَبَعَثَ اللَّهُ لَهُم نَاقَةً فَكَانَتْ تَرِدُ مِن ذَلَكِ الفَجَ فَتَشْرَبُ مَاءَهُم يَوْمَ وُرُودِهَا وَيَحْلِبُونَ مِنْهَا مِثْلَ الَّذِي كَانُوا يَشْرَبُونَ مِنْهَا يَوْمَ غِبِّهَا وَيَصْدِرُونَ عَن ذَلِكَ ، وَهُوَ مَعْنَى قَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى : { وَنَبِئّهُمْ أَنَّ الْمَآءَ قِسْمَةٌ بَيْنَهُم} » الآية.\nوروى البخاري عن ابن عمر أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم لما نزل الحجر في غزوة تبوك أمرهم ألا يشربوا من بئرها ولا يستقوا منها فقالوا: قد عجنا واستقينا فأمرهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يهريقوا ما استقوا ويعلفوا الإبل العجين، وأمرهم أن يستقوا من البئر التي تردها الناقة. \nويتبين لنا من هذه الأحاديث أنه إذا كان رسولنا الكريم صلى الله عليه وسلم قد حدد الفج الذي كانت تدخل منه الناقة والبئر التي كانت تشرب منه فلا يستعبد أن يكون قد حدد الصخرة التي خرجت منها وكذلك بقية التفاصيل المتعلقة بها وقام الصحابة بتداولها كروايات دون نسبتها إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم. \nأما مواصفات الصخرة فسنستخلصها من كتب التفسير ثم نقوم بمقارنتها بمواصفات الصخور الموجودة في الوادي اعتمادا على صور الجوجل إيرث. فقد جاء في تفسير ابن كثير ما نصه \"وفي الصحيح عن ابن عمر أن الناس نزلوا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم على الحجر أرض ثمود، فاستقوا وكانوا هم الذين سألوا صالحاً أن يأتيهم بآية واقترحوا عليه بأن تخرج لهم من صخرة صماء عينوها بأنفسهم وهي صخرة منفردة في ناحية الحجر يقال لها الكاتبة فطلبوا منه أن تخرج لهم منها ناقة عشراء تمخض فأخذ عليهم صالح العهود والمواثيق لئن أجابهم الله إلى سؤالهم وأجابهم إلى طلبتهم ليؤمنن به وليتبعنه فلما أعطوه على ذلك عهودهم ومواثيقهم قام صالح عليه السلام إلى صلاته ودعا الله عز وجل فتحركت تلك الصخرة ثم انصدعت عن ناقة جوفاء وبراء يتحرك جنينها بين جنبيها كما سألوا\". وإذا ما دققنا النظر في صورة الجوجل إيرث التالية نلاحظ وجود صخرة عظيمة مغطاة بالسواد تقع منفردة في أعلى يمين الواد. \nوهذه الصخرة من الضخامة بحيث أنها أقرب لئن تكون جبلا صخريا وهي ذات شكل عجيب مما يؤكد على الرواية التي تقول أن ثمود كانت تعبد آصنامها عندها. ويبلغ أقصى طول للصخرة ألف وخمسمائة متر أما أقصى عرض لها فيبلغ 700 متر ويبلغ أقصى ارتفاع لها مائة متر عن الأرض المحيطة بها. وسنسوق الآن الأدلة التي تثبت أن هذه الصخرة هي التي أخرج الله منها الناقة التي أرسلها آية كدليل على صدق سيدنا صالح عليه السلام.",

    "text": "AlUla tourism has a problem with how they deal with tourists. They have decided that either you pay for a guided bus tour which gives you extremely limited time to see the sights, or you pay too much money to be shepherded around in a \"vintage Land Rover\" (as if anyone cares about what kind of car drives you to a heritage site) for the same amount of time, but without the other people. \nThe experience of Dadan, in all honesty, was a joke. You cannot get close enough to see the only thing of interest at this site. So if you didn't bring your own binoculars, you can share the four provided on site with everyone else. The road is just behind you, you have exactly the same experience from the road. Then, after spending a full three minutes being told about the lions, you are hurried over to play in a sandbox. Twenty minutes. Grown adults who have travelled across the world to see the history of this place were given more time to pretend to dig up pottery than to learn about the site. \nThen you're driven three feet over to see the archaeological site where you're shown photos of the same archaeological site. \n\nJabal Ikmah was better, the engravings and the site itself are astonishing. It was a real pleasure to discover this place and the thousands of years of history it represents. However, once again, be ready to be herded off again way too soon. \nAfter this visit you're given chisels and a rock and can carve some shapes if you're interested. It was actually quite fun at the end of the visit, however the fact that they factor in these kinds of activities that no one asked for into the time and price is frustrating and felt rather infantilising.",

We arrived here by car, which is essential for a complete and independent visit. The main reason tourists come here is Hegra, which alone is worth a visit than Al Ula. We booked the visits to Dadan & Jabal Ikmah and the Old Town online. For the first one, as well as for Hegra, we parked in Winter park while for the second one we used the Old Town North Parking although we can also confirm that Old Town South Parking is closer to the starting point of the tour. The walking tour of the oasis (oasis trail) can be started from several points even if we have considered the best solution to use the car parking located on the other side of the road at the south end of the Old Town.  Among the things to do at sunset without a doubt Elephant Rock and the Harrat viewpoint are unmissable. Al Ula offers many other opportunities for visits and recreation and among them Rainbow Rock and Maraya cannot fail to be mentioned for its uniqueness. Finally, although now temporarily closed, work has begun to expand and repopulate the Sharaan Nature Reserve where in addition to the present animals (red-necked ostriches, regal Nubian ibex, gazelles and Cape hare) the leopard will be reintroduced. We cannot fail to report the kindness and courtesy of those who live here (who have always supported us with information and suggestions), the ease of movement with car and parking and the absolute safety of this town whose only negative aspect (at least one there must be) are the speed cameras. Unmissable and the most interesting place for anyone visiting Saudi Arabia.",

I mean, there is a parks administration. What have they provided for this place in terms of treatment and follow-up? There is a high amount of visual distortion in the park from dry grass, dilapidated sidewalks, holes and neglected trees.\n\nThe bathrooms, may God bless you, are almost non-existent and dirty and need complete maintenance.\n\nYoung people mingle with families.\n\nThe games need maintenance, washing and cleaning.\n\nWhy can't the park be a model? Where is the supervisor and where is the official?!!\n\nWhat do you lack in terms of ideas, creativity and activation of the parks?\n\nIf you had held the facility for a living, you would have ruined it with violations.\n\nThe most failed idea for parks is entry fees.\n\nWhile exploiting activities such as horse racing, swimming pools, amusement parks, grocery stores, cafes, restaurants, etc. ...\nAll for a symbolic rent and the proceeds go to developing the facility.\n\nIn short, every garden or park is a project that an office, employee, or company is responsible for. After structuring and designing it with a creative, exemplary design.\n\nAnd every park competes with the other and surpasses it with better services than the other.\n\nI hope for a kind gesture to these facilities, as they are a breathing space for middle-income and modest families.. I came to have fun and ended up with an inappropriate place and dozens of cats.\n\nI have a lot up my sleeve, but this is what I wanted to offer for the renaissance in my country's breathing spaces 🇸🇦.\n\nAnd God is the Grantor of success.",

When my daughter's time finished, the employer \"G\" called me and told me that I didn't pay the entire amount for my daughter's experience and that I needed to pay an extra 20 riyals due to the incompetence and ineptitude of the employer \"G\". I told her that I clearly specified that I wanted 2 hours for both the archery and trampoline zone and it's her fault due to her negligence. She proceeded to fight with me on the phone for 10 minutes and didn't allow my daughter to play for the entire time I had payed for. After I hanged up on her, she shouted at my daughter and made her cry which showed just how unprofessional she is.\n\nThis place is a scam and filled with a bunch of  incompetent employees.",

Apparently they ordered it to be built in. The mosque's grounds are almost rectangular and extend from west to east. It is 32.5 meters long and 18 meters wide. There are two places to worship, one with winter walls and doors, and the main location is two rows of stone pillars that support the roof. There is a courtyard between the two. It was built between 634 and 644 and is famous for its attractive stone minaret, approximately 12.7 meters tall.\nThe mosque happened to be open and we had a special tour. It has been repaired and appears to be in use today.\nNext to the mosque is Marid Castle, and on the other side is Al Dar'i Quarter.\n/ Daumat Al-Jundal Market.",

I expected the place to be more sophisticated and characterized by upscale services and courteous treatment of visitors.\n\nI hope there are multiple options for cafes, allowing the visitor to choose and not monopolize the place with one coffee shop",

The house is called Al Makkiyah and was 10 years in the making.\nDr Angawi built his house according to the wind. Capturing the wind from the north to the west, the house uses natural ventilation for half  of the year, throughout  different levels, limiting the need for air conditioning \nThe house is constructed from many locally sourced materials. Dr Angawi’s wife Amira is an interior designer and whenever you see interior photographs of the house, you can see just how talented she is.\nI discovered that the house is only available for visits and viewing at particular times and for group tours.\nThere was no such opportunity when I was in Jeddah, other than admiring the exterior of the house.\nThe research I did allowed me to discover that when there are opportunities for visits to the house the tickets cost around 200 riyals, which I believe includes tea being served to you.\nIt is difficult to find information on how you obtain tickets to see the house, if indeed this is still possible.\nI would have loved to see the interior of this architectural masterpiece",

My son and I are playing with these little balls and she said I should not throw the balls, I wasnt even throwing it outside the pit, but throwing it on my son. Another instance, I was feeding my child with her milk bottle, and we sat in the ball pit, there was not much kids there like maybe 2 or 3 but not in our area and she asked us to move away from that area. I was taking a video of my daughter and she told me she will pass as she wants to clean the balls (she doesnt want to be caught in the video).\n\nC'mon that is a playing area, to enjoy and have fun. I was really in bad mood that day because of that. We finished early and didnt consume the 1hour I paid.\n\nI hope they add more playing options for toddlers/babies.

They were cooperative, courteous, and keen on the comfort of the children and their families, which gave a better experience to the place.\nMy special thanks go out to Nouf Al-Ghamdi\n\nCurrently, there is a discount from the Waffarha application, and the ticket is now only 55 riyals instead of the regular price! The offer continues until January 31, an opportunity for those who want to benefit from the discount and live an enjoyable experience with their children. I highly recommend it to you",

This is in addition to the drinks and the accompanying food. It would be better for me to rent a rest house for the whole day, 24 hours. Frankly, the prices are very, very exaggerated. Please adjust the prices if you gain customers on a weekly basis, other than the children’s dinner, snacks, and juices. I mean, the whole trip cost me a thousand riyals. Why, God forbid you?",

The 1 star rating is because of the reaction of the man at the front desk who was very sarcastic of our feedback.  He was dismissive and commented “why? Did you go under the water? Am I supposed to give you some drops?”\n\nWith these prices, and this attitude, it’s better to close the place.",

    "text": "Maybe you should teach your employees to treat people equally as my son already scanned his bracelet and we wanted to enter and the lady from entrance decided to just let someone else to enter in front of us like we was invisible because the lady was saudi. If she s saudi she s still equal with anyone to wait in lane. I am from Europe and still didn t act like i m the queen and I need to enter in front of people because of what nationality I have. Also to start and gossip about me and the lady from cashier to come inside just to watch what I am wearing is also un polite . You need to teach them some manners. Also the rule with not allowing my husband to enter with us doesn’t make sense when you have a male inside selling candies. So if it s a no men rule, than make it until the end no men rule. I also do not feel comfortable to be alone with men employee without my husband! Your rules do not make sense at all! You either make it full closed the glass so no men can see inside and no men employee inside, either give up on the non sense rule that fathers can’t enter with their kids. Fathers need to be part of kids life as part of their development and this is exactly the time when they have the time to spend it with them. I just moved from UAE and i m shocked that fathers are not treating as same important like mothers. In UAE  we always enter together both with our son in any playground!",

    "text": "This play area has the potential to be nice. The bottom floor has a trampoline area and a swing area that works as an obstacle coarse. The upstairs area has a coffee bar, a selection of kids toys that can be used sitting at the table as well as a sandbox and ball pit.\n\nUnfortunately, the lady at the front desk is rude and apathetic. She barely looked up from her phone long enough to speak to me. Worst than that… the place is a safety hazard!\n\nI found a large screw fallen on the floor in the play area! It had obviously fallen into the play area where one of the walls was falling, leaving a giant opening leading to the cement floor under the trampoline. When I showed the employe that my child could fall through and hit the floor, she did nothing and continued sitting on her phone.\n\nThe steps leading up to the play area are NOT secured. It detached and rolled when I stepped on it, hitting my leg and causing me to trip, almost falling and dropping my child. It also left me with a bleeding leg and a giant bruise. When I spoke to the lady, her paraphrased response was “what do you want me to do I’m just an employee”. I told her to call her manager and request a worker come to secure the step and fix the fallen wall. She only went to fix the fallen wall after I mentioned liability and reporting the place to the correct authority.\n\nIt’s unfortunate because the place could have been a nice place. I wouldn’t come again unless the customer service improves and the safety concerns are addressed. I also wouldn’t drive more than ten minutes to reach here. It is ok if you live nearby and your kids are bored of their regular spots, but again, not with the current customer service and safety hazards.\n\nThe maid Rashida was kind and attentive to the children, which I appreciate.",

Worse than that the management did not understand the situation at all!! All they cared about is their money! They refused to give us our money back and insisted for my daughter to understand the coach personality (my daughter is 6!!!! They should understand her feelings!!!) they handled the situation in a totally selfish way! Bad bad bad experience, would never ever recommend anyone to take their kids there!!! 👎🏼👎🏼\n\nIn a place like this all they should care about is the child feelings and safety!! AND their clients!

I bought my family special socks for games, and they are not willing to let them into the trampoline, and I don’t even want to go with them by air, even though the other branch allows them. The problem is that their socks are a copy and paste of the ones I took, Oh God, my right, and they are white, and they only have the logo of the place. And I attached the tassels to them. I can see the children sliding on the floor with it 😕🤣. Half of the screens are closed, and most of the balls are broken. It could be that they hurt the children and other things. Unfortunately, these problems I encountered in this branch only. However, The Village branch is very excellent and the female employees are very cooperative.",

The friendliness and kindness of everyone is what makes this restaurant even more astounding than the decor and the food. Our waitress was lovely and well versed on the whole menu. The manager Maida was polite, professional, warm and very sincere. We had the crab salad, edamame, one of the Nikkei (highly recommended by our waitress, very delicious, but I can’t remember which one), and the black cod as well as their cheesecake. Just impeccable presentation, notes and textures and aromas and flavours in every bites, perfection at its finest. Thank you all for a delectable experience, we will definitely come back for more.",

Money minting : From the start till end, you can have a feeling , there is a desire to rob people off their money. Too many games and rides with overly priced tickets. Less or almost zero free entertainment but more  expensive games/rides.\n3. If you have time, better to visit Riyadh ( Boulevard World & City), which is 100 times better and value for money.\n4.

They’ve added a bowling area, which is a great activity for both parents and kids to enjoy together. A nice bonus: if you play bowling, you get free drinks and popcorn. So, 5 stars for the bowling!",

Shisha are  available too. With regards to the food offered by the restaurant-I can say that it’s unsatisfactorily and quite expensive. We ordered the chicken slider which is 71sr for 3 mini burgers and the wagyu sliders for 80sr. They have exciting rides and games too. So if you’re an adrenaline junkie- expect to spend 1000sr 😄😂",

She doesn’t answer. She is afraid and cries. I ask them. They say, “Let her tell us who hit her,” and we understand. Ok. The girl is afraid and does not speak. If you ask the children with her who hit her, do not let her cry as if nothing happened. I say to them, okay, look at the cameras. What happened to her? My daughter is in pain from her side. I know what happened to her. They say bring a police report so we can review the cameras? In the first place, if he had cared about children, this would not have happened\nThe important thing is that my advice to anyone whose child does not take his rights into his own hands and is afraid for him is not to enter it because the situation is survival of the fittest",

The classrooms are not equipped to teach children, as they lack any educational and sensory means.\n\nAll the educational, cognitive, color, and other aspects are located in a large room below, and all the school participates in them.\n\nMeaning that children of each age group have an hour in this room that collects all the activities, and for the rest of the day, what do they do?...\n\nFourth.  The sand room is not spacious and narrow, meaning it cannot accommodate 15 children per class.\n\nFifth. Changing diapers, may God bless you, for children on the same changing table without a changing mat under each child and a diaper, no gloves or other clothes. Look at the amount of germs that will be transferred from one child to another.\n\nVI. Most importantly, there is no bedroom for the children. The children sleep in the same classroom where the child’s owners sit, eat and play...reasonable.\n\nAnd to those who asked them: How do you tell the employee to go to the quietest class and put the sleeping child? It is not logical to move the child to a class every day to sleep...\nI didn't like the place",

Despite charging 89 SAR for a mere 2 hours, half of the playground is either broken, closed, or looks abandoned. When approached, the staff seemed indifferent and directed me to their unresponsive manager. It's disheartening to see employees expressing their concerns about missing toys, yet seeing no action taken. Expecting patrons to pay full price for a facility that is clearly not maintained or fully functional is unjust. The cleanliness is also questionable, adding to the disappointment. As of August 2023, this playground feels more like a scam than a place of fun. Save your money and time by considering other options.",

    "text": "Very disapointed. It took a while to schedule this family visit and then it took a while to get there, due to the traffic and when we did, we were surprised to find a number of the rides were not working: the carousel, the ice skating rink and the terminator to name but a few. My son is 128cm, so could not go on most of the rides, which start at 130cm. He was able to ride on the baby bumper cars, the water bumper cars and the big slide, which are designed for younger children. He is 9, but short for his age, but overall, he found those rides ok. He had been looking forward to ice skating, so was sad to find that the rink had turned into a seating area. Many of the indoor games were also not working. My son did get a chance to climb the climbing wall, which was good. What we found most frustrating, was that the rides (and not the food stalls) closed during prayer and we had nothing to do for 30 minutes.  The park looks like it has not been renovated for over 10 years, with red/white tape placed on games, and doors that are no longer working. It really needs a revamp. There used to be a fountain but that was not working during our visit either. Will not be returning unless the place makes some real changes and please fix up your website Happy Land, it provides no information.",

In 1050, Persian poet Naser Khusrow visited Jeddah and recorded that the sturdy walls made of coral reef limestone have two gates on the sea and Mecca side, with 5,000 boys and a bustling bazaar. Apparently it's still there. At the beginning of the 16th century, Jeddah was attacked by Portuguese troops and Bewynns, so Marmuk's sultan Gauri rebuilt the fortress wall surrounding the city in 1509 to protect the city. Apparently he ordered it to do so. The walls were demolished in 1947 as the city developed, but there are seven gates in total, at Bab Makkah, Bab Al-Madina, Bab Al-Sharif, Bab Al-Bint, Bab Al-Mughrabi It appears that Bab Al-Jadeed and Bab Al-Saba were added at the beginning of the 20th century. This Bab Al-Jadeed appears to have been built for cars to pass through.\nToday, the gate is located in a square with a large road passing nearby. This is the gateway to visit the old townscape and buildings of Jeddah.",

    "text": "Clinic Heritage Museum is a facility by Clinic where you can experience the local culture. We visited by bus on a local guided tour from Japan. While waiting for lunch, we received dates, coffee, water and more in a large tent. We had a delicious lunch in a tent somewhere else, and then we visited a well where two white camels were walking around to draw water, and a garden where the water was flowing through narrow channels. There were also so many buildings and old tools that could be made from soil. The site is large and it appears that students are visiting. Right next to the site is Jubbah Rock Art Heritage, which was registered as a World Heritage Site in 2015, and it seems to be the standard way to visit together, making it a very popular facility among local Saudi Arabians.\nThe method of collecting water from a well is that a rope is connected to a large bag located inside the well, and as the camel moves forward, the rope is pulled and the bag containing water is lifted. It's very well done and fun to watch.\nMr. Clinic was very kind and posed under the gate for photos, and he actually moved it and showed me that the wooden pulley above the gate was moving.",

According to Islamic tradition, it was at this well that the Prophet Muhammad and his followers took refuge during their migration from Mecca to Medina.\n\nAside from its historical significance, Ghar'a Well is also significant due to its architectural style and design. The well is made up of a series of interconnected underground chambers, which were designed to store water and protect it from the elements. The walls of the chambers are made of dressed stone and the well has a distinctive, domed roof that is made of brick.\n\nVisitors to Ghar'a Well can still see the remains of the well and its surrounding structures, which have been partially restored in recent years. The site is open to visitors and is a popular destination for tourists and religious pilgrims alike.\n\nIn conclusion, Ghar'a Well is a unique and important historical site in Medina, Saudi Arabia, that has great significance for both its historical and architectural value. Its status as a place of refuge for the Prophet Muhammad and his followers during their migration makes it a revered and sacred site for Muslims, and its distinctive design and architecture make it a fascinating place to visit for visitors of all backgrounds.",

The place lacked the spirit of fun that a child needs. The world was dark and the employees were not enthusiastic about registering my daughter. That day, I went to the grounds where there was a Frozen and Snowman party, but there was nothing there at all, just free play and half the corners were floating!\nWhen I asked them, they said because those present were young, under 5 years old!\n\nI wish more attention was paid to the content of the place.. because the building really deserves to be the most beautiful entertainment place for children in the city 👌🏼",

What upsets me is that only two of the 6 games are good and bad, but the rest of the games are old, blurry, and not balanced. And when they said, they say that we are ordering glasses from China, so why? You arrive and everything goes well. For example, if I come to you again Will you play with me for free!? I don't think it means, what benefit will I do when you play bad games with me!!! And you say that! The important thing is that if you go and try the first game and the cube-breaking game, do not take anything like it, because it is forbidden to spend money on something that is broken, and the experience will not be complete and enjoyable.",

Prophet loved him very much and cannot easily forget his loss. Many other Martyrs who lost their precious lives in this battle are also buried here. Pilgrims to Madinah don’t forget to visit this place along with Mount Uhud & it is a part of the itinerary of the local tour operators. Nobody is allowed inside the enclosure which has a grill gate, but it is visible from outside. Best time is to visit either in the morning or in the evening, otherwise it is very hot& humid. There are lot of shops opposite to it selling various items like dates, honey, medicinal herbs, clothings etc. \n        Prophet during his lifetime used to visit the graves of Martyrs of Uhud and hence it is sunnah (good practice) to follow & visit the same. But care should be taken not to indulge in un-Islamic practice or Biddat such as performing Tawaaf, tying threads, throwing money etc. Don’t miss the opportunity to rekindle your faith.",

We are drawn to these sacred cities by a desire to explore their rich religious, historical, and cultural significance, steeped in the spiritual aura of Islam. During our recent visit to Madinah, we had the privilege of visiting the house of Syeda Fatimah bint Husayn, a place deeply entrenched in history. She built this house and a well inside it when she moved from her grandmother Fatima's (RA) house. This move was necessitated when Fatima's house became part of the expanding Prophet's Mosque. Syeda Fatimah remained in Madinah while her father participated in the battle of Karbala, where he ultimately met his martyrdom in 110 AH. Fatima was also present in Karbala and was later taken as a captive to Kufa and then to Damascus, along with other members of Imam Hussain's family. Despite the hardships she endured, Fatima played a crucial role as a narrator of the tragic events of Karbala and its aftermath. It is said that Syeda Fatimah's resemblance to her grandmother, Fatima (RA), the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), was striking, adding a poignant layer to her story. Her life and experiences are a testament to the resilience and strength of faith that characterize the descendants of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).",

    "text": "It is the most blessed graveyard of the Muslims in the world. Its importance and sacrosanctness lies in the fact that, Prophet’s (Peace be upon him) wives, daughters, son Ibrahim, and inneumerable companions are buried her. It faces his Tomb opposite the entrance named Baqi, of the Grand Mosque of Madinah. It is a vast area with concretely laid pathways. There are no markings or structures on the graves of such a large number of blessed souls, unlike other Muslim graves in the world. Moreover, entry to this place is also restricted to males only and in the appointed hours in the morning & evening only, and not at all times of the day. Every Muslim in the world longs to be buried here to attain salvation. Every Pilgrim to Mecca for Haj&Umra visits Madinah and every visitor to Madinah makes it a point to visit this place. A large number of birds mostly pigeons can be seen here and visitors feed them also. A visit to this place will definitely give peace & contentment to the soul.",

It is a small mountain in Arafat, at the base of which the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ supplicated during his farewell pilgrimage and delivered the Farewell Sermon to the Muslims who had accompanied him for the Hajj towards the end of his life. On the 9th of Dhul Hijjah, thousands of pilgrims gather around this mountain during the most important rite of Hajj. It is also known as the Mount of Mercy located at a barren plain some 20 kilometers (12 mi) east of Makkah, where the pilgrims stand in contemplative vigil. The granite hill reaches about 70 m in height. The Day is known as the day where if sought after, millions of Muslims' sins are forgiven by Allah, and He perfected the religion of Islam. Some Muslims believe that Mount Arafat is the place where Adam and Eve reunited on Earth after falling from Heaven. A pillar is erected on top of the mountain to show where this event is believed to have taken place. The Makkah Metro has been serving this location since 2010. On a typical Hajj, the walk is roughly 21 km.",

    "text": "This is the cave that the prophet (saw) and his companion (ra) escaped to save their lives while being chased by trackers. It’s a steep mountain. Anyone with back problems of any kind or mobility concerns should not attempt this mountain. It takes 2 hours for an able bodied person to climb and up to 4 hours for anyone else. Rocks are steep and the journey is treacherous winding up the mountain. You are constantly near to cliff edges there are no barriers to stop you falling so you must have good treads on your shoes to grip. You go up and down the same way. Many people will be using the same route as you. There are small hut shops dotted along the route so you can buy water and snacks if yours run out. I highly recommend a sugar fix maybe juice or chocolate to normalise your blood pressure for when you reach the top. There is a snack hut at the top. And no there are no toilets along any of the route. When you reach the top access to the small cave is tiny. Only a few people can fit. There will be a small queue for those wanting to offer prayers inside the cave. Coming down is harder than upwards because gravity will make you go faster. Many people fall and slip on the gravel on the way down. Take it slow. Don’t try and be fast, or smart. You cannot outwit nature. I saw people with diabetes, high blood pressure, old age, mobility issues, cry tears of pain and exhaustion having come so far and have to turn back because the physical pain was just too much to bear. If you have to walk a lot the next day then this uphill climb is not for you. It will leave you exhausted, tired, and ladies will get swollen ankles and feet. Go with a positive mindset. Take it very slow. Good grip shoes or trainers. Take snacks and liquids. Set aside at least 3 to 4 hours uphill. And 2 hours downhill. When you get to the top it is worth seeing and feeling what the Beloved had to go through. A spiritual place indeed. Don’t worship it. Be considerate of it and mindful of the mercy and miracle the Almighty bestowed on his Beloved.",

    "text": "I loved being out in the water with all my friends, and nothing could have ruined that but honestly the staff during our trip nearly did. I’m a fairly experienced kayaker in seas, lakes, rivers and rapids and this is the first time I have been discriminated against because of my size. (I would say I’m small-mid fat, US size 16-18) The member of staff told me and my whole group that I should use a double kayak “because of my weight” but didn’t back this up with an explanation. Maybe the kayaks here are cheaper and less sea worthy than others I’ve used previously. I did it anyway to save embarrassment and time because the process of getting us on the water was very slow. As it happened, the girl who shared with me was much smaller and the weight distribution was completely wrong due to this being a double kayak. I felt unsafe the whole time but luckily, as mentioned I am experienced and a very strong swimmer.  Then we had a great time all kayaking together and swimming together, but at the end another member of staff suggested we set up a photo for breast cancer awareness and told us to “form the shape of a ribbon with our kayaks”. She had no idea how to direct this and expected us to just know how to make the shape she envisioned with no help or leadership. We tried for about 10 minutes but all ended up very frustrated and cranky because we couldn’t get this task right. Then we had an equally slow process of getting out of our kayaks as we had getting in them. \n\nSo to sum up- you will have fun with your friends, but prepared to be fat shamed if you dare to be out in public in a swimsuit and you are over a size 16.",

Have tried many coffee shops over the town and this by far one of the best of all, prices are great comparing to others, and the staff is very friendly!!\n\nFor cold go with “Spanish Latte” or “Pistachio Latte”\nFor hot go with “Latte” or “V60”\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! I’m so glad I found this place by chance it’s newly opened, hope they expand to more areas around the town.",

    "text": "I gave 5 🌟s and here is why...the coffee is amazing!\nI ordered a hot mocha, an iced vanilla drink, and an ice tea.\nMy family agreed that all of the drinks were very tasty and satisfying. We ordered a chocolate and blueberry muffin, and a slice of blueberry cheesecake, and 3 egg and cheese sandwiches. The muffins were warm so they tasted pretty good. The cheesecake was old and very stale BUT! In their defense they replaced it the next day with a slice that was much better. Being from the USA it was not the cheesecake taste that i was use to but someone said that cheesecake here is made differently and when you compare the two I guess that the extremely rich decadent version is not all that good for ya...whatever you need to tell yourself right?🤣\nSo as I was writing above, they redeemed themselves the next day with a fresh slice so all was well.\nThey offered me a free coffee as well but as I mentioned above, the mocha coffee was very tasty so there was no need.\nAm I the only one that did not know that here in Riyadh an egg and cheese sandwich means \"a boiled egg\" and cheese sandwich? Anywho...\nThe brother who comes outside to wait on you is very kind, pleasant. And efficient!  Yes, I did write that he comes outside, takes your order and returns pretty promptly to your car with your food.\nEven though I was served in my car I gave 5 🌟 because well the waiter created a very pleasant atmosphere 😊\nI think that their business is going to grow once word gets around that you are served old style at the window of your car.. I worry though about the traffic, and parking space once business picks up. It is very limited and shared with other businesses 🤔\nI should mention that they are a bit pricy. I spent 92SAR. Didn't really pay attention because I was paying with a card😕. When I returned the next day and realized that a coffee and muffin was 20SAR...let's just say that my new breakfast place won't see me as often as I thought.",

I think their coffee bean is what makes the difference. They have their peak times, for sure and it can get a bit loud. But they also have books and games to pass the time. They also have outdoor seating options as well. The cashier is always smiling and knows the menu very well. Overall, I enjoy coming here. With regards to parking, it’s you and your luck, not many parking spaces since they share with other places.",

The café has a cozy and modern ambiance, perfect for a quiet coffee break or catching up with friends. The coffee was excellent, with a rich flavor and just the right balance of bitterness and sweetness.\n\nThe baristas were friendly and attentive, ensuring that my order was prepared exactly to my liking. I also appreciated the variety of pastries available, which paired well with my drink.\n\nOne area for improvement would be the seating arrangement, which can feel a bit cramped during busy hours. However, this is a minor issue in an otherwise pleasant café. Overall, Coffee Address is a great spot for quality coffee in a relaxed setting. I’ll definitely be returning!",

The food was outstanding, the atmosphere was welcoming, and the service was thoughtful.\n\nOur Orders:\n1.\tTurkish Simit (with added salmon) – The flavors were well-balanced, and it suited our taste perfectly.\n2.\tKing’s Croissant – A massive pastry with a slight spicy kick, adding an enjoyable twist.\n3.\tScrambled Egg Börek – Flaky, flavorful, and exceeded my expectations.\n4.\tMushroom Croissant – Rich, well-prepared, and delicious.\n5.\tMilk Cake – Complimentary due to delayed tea; incredibly soft, creamy, and a delightful surprise.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm and inviting. Despite the place being crowded, it wasn’t overly noisy, making it a comfortable setting. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table, but it was definitely worth it. The location is also practical, with plenty of parking spaces available downstairs. Additionally, the place is kid-friendly, making it a great option for families.\n\nOverall, Home Bakery Riyadh delivered an excellent brunch experience with high-quality food, great service, and a cozy ambiance. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a delicious and enjoyable dining experience.",

Brilliant taste, excellent service and great new ambience.\n\nService (9/10): Fast service, neat and tidy place. The baristas and hosts were cordial. COVID checks done at entry.\n\nAmbience (9/10): I personally love dark themed cafes and restaurants so I am rating it highly however the internal decor is really fantastic.\n\nDrinks (8/10): The taste was appealing and it is surely a place I would recommend for an unique experience. As it is located in the The Zone, the external setting too enhances the mood. The price is a bit on the higher side which was slightly unsettling.\n\nDrinks Ordered :\n1. Spout Latte (Cold) : A very unique blend of strong and sweet cold latte. A very special taste which I haven't had anywhere yet. It is strong as well as sweet which was really mind-blowing for me.\n2. Spanish Latte (Cold): Their Spanish latte was also great in taste but nothing special in terms of uniqueness.\n\nBudget : 45-65 SAR for two.",

They use to display books where you can trade & donate your old books displayed in their cafe.\n\nI just noticed some changes in the taste of their coffee ( taste before is way  better) I think they changed their supplier of beans or what but overall their coffee is still good but the older version were way better.\n\nThe Park Avenue Staff were all accommodating .

I took an iced spanish latte. I also took a croissant which, when heated, is very crispy on the outside and soft and squishy on the inside. Its really big and is a great size. Overall a good place but the coffee is kind of basic.",

    "text": "A beautiful day, Good morning, Riyadh, It is Wednesday, and I am on the road to my next destination,Calibrated Coffee Roasters. I had aligned with the owner (Mr. Mohammed), yesterday to take pictures and videos for my review.\n\nThe ambiance is beautiful, with a nice aesthetic design, comfortable seating,  white curtains, and indoor plants, adorning the Café.\n\nThere is  both indoor and outdoor seating, and the views are amazing, especially King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) buildings and some prominent hotels (Move n Pick) on the opposite side of the road.\n\nThe expert barista and roaster is Mr. Mohammed Fouad, from Yemen 🇾🇪 with over 3 years experience and Mr. Sujal from Nepal 🇳🇵 is the barista with over 2 years of experience. Let's discover the coffee.\n\nThe first is a Kalita drip coffee hot, brewed by hand with Colombia 🇨🇴 NARINO coffee beans with a cup flavor profile of fruity, sweetness, apple, full texture, the sweet taste and flavor was refreshing. My rating is 10 out of 10.\n\nThe second is an espresso double shot brewed with Ethiopia GUJI SHAKISO coffee beans with a cup flavor profile of fruity, sweetness, jasmine, green apple, rich texture. It is indulgent with balanced acidity and velvety creamy body. My rating is 10 out of 10.\n\nThe last is Flat White, prepared with Brazil ROSA MORENA coffee beans with a cup flavor profile of floral, moderate sweetness, smooth acidity, and a rich body. The expertise of barista was evident (standard hot temperature doing the trick). The taste was nice and balanced. My rating is 9 out of 10.\n\nThe three desserts paired with the coffees have been ideal in complimenting the flavors of the coffee.\n\nThe Cinnamon had a well-balanced sweetness and smooth texture of the brioche, the topping of caramel, and Dulce de Leche sauce with nuts had me craving for....every bite was pure delight with Kalita drip coffee. My rating is 10 out of 10.\n\nThe crunchy bite (chocolate and toasted coconut) had a nice taste and flavor perfect with the espresso double shot coffee. My rating is 9 out of 10.\n\nThe pecan tart had a mild flavor and taste. The tarts are meant to be rich with crunch of the pecans and firm texture of the tart shell ... this one was just not there... missing the finesse . My rating is 8 out of 10.\n\nOverall rating is 9.5 out of 10.\n\n@Mr. Mohammed (owner), Fouad (Expert Barista & Roaster), and Sujal (Barista), thanks for hosting me today.\n\nAn unforgettable and memorable experience of my food journey in search of the best cafés, bakeries, and restaurants.\n\nFun fact:\n\"During coffee tasting, judges slurp it across the entirety of their mouth so they can accurately taste all the nuances in a coffee’s flavour This is done because your tongue detects sweetness, while the back of your throat is tuned for bitterness.",

We recently visited as a group and were blown away by how cooperative and accommodating the staff were. A special shoutout to Mr. Hani and the supervisor, who went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing experience. They even reserved the entire second floor for us, providing a private and comfortable space for our gathering.\n\nTo top it all off, they generously offered us a 15% discount on our bill, which was a pleasant surprise. The ambiance of the place is fantastic, with a relaxed and inviting vibe that makes you want to stay longer. The drinks were spot on, with the chocolate mousse standing out as a personal favorite—it's rich, heavy, but absolutely delicious.\n\n8oz Coffee has definitely earned a spot as one of my go-to places in the city, not just for the quality of the drinks, but for the exceptional customer service. I will certainly be visiting many times in the future and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great café experience in Riyadh.",

The place is more meant for people smoking shisha, so the drink prices are more expensive (free if you smoke shisha). First time I’ve seen V60 more expensive than Chemex, so that was confusing. Love the upstairs seating area. No one was smoking there while I was there.",

The baristas were very welcoming and their coffee art is just spectacular. The service i must say is one of the best I experienced in KSA. The coffee taste is spot on. A bit expensive but with the location, ambience, the all in all mood of the place and the service, the price just gave it justice.\n\nHighly recommended in Riyadh. A definite MUST Visit! 👍😘👌\n\n#weekendvibes\n#novembercafe",

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the warm and welcoming staff, who are undoubtedly the stars of the show. Their friendly demeanor set the perfect tone for my visit.\n\nThe ambiance of the cafe is delightful, making it an ideal spot for a relaxing breakfast. I was impressed by the wide variety of offerings on the menu, which made it hard to choose! I settled on the Bacon with Egg Benedict Toast and a pot of Americano. While the Americano didn’t quite meet my expectations, the Bacon and Egg Benedict absolutely stole the show. It was a perfect combination that left my soul and stomach feeling wonderfully satisfied.\n\nTo top off my meal, I couldn’t resist trying the milk cake, and it was fantastic—finger-licking good! Every bite was a treat, and it perfectly complemented my breakfast.\n\nOverall, my experience at L’eto Cafe was exceptional, and I will definitely be adding it to my list of favorites. I highly recommend this cafe to anyone looking for a delicious meal in a welcoming atmosphere!",

Their coffee is always smooth, rich, and perfectly brewed.. whether I’m in the mood for a strong espresso or their signature Arabic coffee with a hint of cardamom. I also love their new Saudi Latte. Pairing it with their delicious dates that is sooo good makes it even better!\n\nWhat truly makes this place special is the service. The staff is always warm, welcoming, and attentive, making every visit feel like a treat. Especially the Manager Mahmoud, and his staff like Zander, Joy and Irene which give us extra special service. Whether I’m here for a quick coffee or a relaxed break, I always leave satisfied. Highly recommended!",

I am so happy and excited to visit yet another new destination, I am at Sulalat,  a world of the finest specialty luxury coffees.\n\nMy colleagues at work, Nama and AJS, wanted me to do a review of Sulalat popular for premium coffees and baked treats. Let's go ... discover Sulalat.\n\nThe espresso single shot was the ultimate experience of a coffee connoisseur, heavy creamy body with oud and cacao notes prepared from Exit 13 (Sulalat blend), coffee beans from Indonesia (Java), Gautamela, and Ethiopia. My rating is a perfect 10 out of 10.\n\nThe coffee latte was  exquisite as the barista followed the recipe to the T (36 to 43 seconds to get it right!). The Exit 13 Sulalat blend is a delightful selection. My rating is 9 out of 10.\n\nThe Aeropress drip coffee uses Aljoud coffee beans from Saudi Arabia (locally grown in Southern Region -Jazan), and the method to prepare is unique and different. The last step required a  press to release all the goodness of a black coffee. My rating is 11 out of 10.\n\nThe baked treats and amazing assortment of croissants, the brownie croissant with vanilla, chocolate, and caramel filling was a flavor burst. Oh wow! Oh yum! What was that! My rating is 10 out of 10.\n\nThe plain croissant, a humble baked goodness, it is light soft, fluffy, crispy, and simply delicious paired with coffee latte ... hmmm. My rating is 9 out of 10.\n\nOverall rating is a perfect 10 out of 10.\n\n@Sulalat team (Ahmed, Mustafa, Neezar) and all the staff, thank you for hosting me today!\n\nAn unforgettable memorable experience in my food journey, in search of the best cafes, bakeries, and restaurants.",

I’ve been looking for a place that would serve delicious chocolate crepe with ice cream for a reasonable price and Haten has it! 20 SAR for a crepe with ice cream is a great deal considering other places would charge more for the same! Their crepe was fresh and delicious however I wish they could put more chocolate on the top. Their coffee was great too! They have a lot of other aesthetic deserts and pastries which you definitely should try! The atmosphere is very calm with friendly staff and spacious seating arrangement.\n\nThe location is very far from the city centre but I would happily drive all the way to come and try more of their menu items!",

In Dose they had plenty of staff and many more customers, so well done to the ops team for understanding the need for people interaction. We took a cold and hot version of the pistachio coffees and both were amazing. Will be back and referring our friends to try. Excellent place, people and product!",

It's already Saturday, Good morning, Riyadh, \"Saturday is a gentle reminder to enjoy the little things in life.” Today, I am at Some Coffee Bar bright and early at 6 AM, I have the go-ahead to take pictures and videos for my review.\n\nThe ambiance is beautiful with lots of natural light, well designed, and great seating.\n\nThere is a variety of coffee beans on display and awesome selection of cheesecakes, pastries, and croissants. Let's discover Some Coffee Bar and evaluate the delightful treats!\n\nThe barista of the day is Mr. Javed Aziz, from Kashmir, India 🇮🇳 😀 😎 and today he is brewing a  couple of espresso shots, a couple of V60 drip coffees, and a Cortado.\n\nThe espresso single shot brewed with Ethiopia Sidamo coffee beans with a cup profile of walnut, peach, and choco, awesome crema, and fruity bittersweet flavor and taste, my rating is 10 out of 10.\n\nThe next surprise, is another espresso single shot, but this time it is brewed with China Honey King coffee beans with a cup profile of honey, raspberry, and grape, awesome crema, nice fruity sweet flavor and taste, my rating is 10 out of 10.\n\nThe Cortado is a single espresso shot made with Colombia Santa Rosa coffee beans with a cup profile of fruity pomegranate sweetness and an equal portion of latte. My first impression is that it had a bit more latte diluting the boldness of the espresso. My rating is 8 out of 10.\n\nThe V60 brewed by the machine with Ethiopia Sidamo coffee beans had a fruity bittersweet flavor profile, and my rating is 9 out of 10.\n\nThe next cup of drip coffee V60 hot, brewed by the machine with Rwanda Gesheke coffee beans, had nuts, peach, fruity cup.profie, bittersweet taste, and flavor.  My rating is 9 out of 10.\n\nNow for the sweet treats, the Raspberry Danish pastry with nice crispy layered puff pastry with delicious pistachio custard and topped with fresh raspberries, an outright best seller. My rating is 11 out of 10.\n\nThe Belgian chocolate cookie was delicate, soft, and tasty, a bit too greasy for my palate and hands (too oily). My rating is 7 out of 10.\n\nOverall rating is 9 out of 10.\n\n@Mr. Javed Aziz and Mr. Md Motaleb Hosen, and the entire team at Some Coffee Bar. Thanks for hosting me today.\n\nAnother unforgettable and memorable experience of my food journey in search of the best cafes, bakeries, and restaurants.",

Although the price is a little bit expensive but damn the pistachio cake was superb.\n\nOne thing I’d like to suggest is that, change all the cups for coffee to ceramics. Plastic fiber glass is fine but ceramics can hold the coffee hot for too long. Just saying! 😊 over all experience was lovely 💓\n\nKeep it up guys!",

    "text": "It's Thursday, yet another gorgeous, beautiful day on the road to my next destination.\n\nGood morning, Riyadh. I stopped by at Tamimi supermarket to buy fruits, and then, as I was browsing through a list of cafes, I clicked on Kicksters, and here I am, sharp at 6:10 AM.\n\nI greet Saeed (a seasoned barista) and get permission to take pictures and videos for my review.\n\nI am scanning the cafe and wondering how I can showcase the interiors. Wall painting, plants through pictures. Let's see ... the  ambiance is  simple, nice seating, and welcoming....\n\nThere are an impressive variety of coffee beans on display, and today, the Ethiopian, West Arsi, Erlium (the crop is grown at 2100 - 1945 altitude, the cupping notes are fruity, chocolate, black grape) this coffee variety is used to prepare a hot cup of V60 coffee (machine made), Saeed did the processing from start to finish 😋, well done! my rating is 9 out of 10.\n\nMy dessert for today is a brownie, crunchy chocolate, and rocky road. It was a delightful selection, and the sweet treats complimented well with the V60 coffee. My rating is 9 out of 10.\n\nOverall rating is 9 out of 10.\n\n@Saeed and team (Asadul, Samir, and Eman), thanks for hosting me today.",

I tried the flat white, and it was amazing perfectly balanced and creamy.\n\nAdditionally, Moosh offers a points system. They ask for your phone number at each visit to add points, which can be redeemed for rewards later on. It's a great way to get even more value out of your visits.\n\nOverall, Moosh combines convenience, quality, and exceptional service. If you're in the area, it's a must-visit especially if Keshav is there to serve you!",

The people there were friendly and very welcoming! Having great service definitely adds to the overall experience. And my experience here was great.\n\nThe cafe follows a clean and minimal aesthetic with super comfortable seats that are well spaced out with the serving area right in the middle of the cafe. We were given both the signature drinks, The Hot and Iced Central Latte, Cheese turkey sandwich, Chicken Teriyaki Sandwich, Iced Spanish Latte, Hot Chocolate, Two Coffee of the days which were essentially Black Coffees but one of them with milk, and a Blueberry Cheesecake. I really liked the Iced Central Latte, it’s good and it can cover a wide range of customers preferences, not the best for those who love a strong coffee taste in their drink, for that sort of preference I’d definitely recommend the Coffee of the day and the Hot Central Latte. They were strong in taste and Rich in Raw Coffee flavour. They’re not for me but if you like that type of coffee I definitely recommend you try it. The Hot Chocolate was lovely, and so was the Blueberry Cheesecake. And the sandwiches were great too, The Chicken Teriyaki’s bread felt a bit dry but other then that it was good. The Spanish Latte was good, not the best by any means, but not bad either.",

    "text": "It is Thursday, a beautiful day, great weather, nice and sunny, perfect for a good brew of delicious coffee and dessert ... hmmm ... so tempting!\n\nGood morning, Riyadh. My next destination is recommended by my colleague at wor, Mr. Dmitry Trubkin, I have seen this cafe and roastery many times on my way to work. Well, the day has come sooner than expected.\n\nI am super excited to review Core Coffee & Roastery (by dr. Cafe Coffee) located inside Jarir Bookstore building on Thumamah road.\n\nI met the two expert baristas, Mr. Qasim and Mr. Abdulrahman and I have the go-ahead to take pictures and videos for my review.\n\nThe espresso single shot is brewed from the signature blend (coffee beans from Central America), tasting notes tropical fruits, dark chocolate, and hazelnut. The flavor and taste were smooth, creamy, and medium-roast. My rating is a perfect 10 out of 10.\n\nThe flat white was also made from the signature blend with a single espresso shot, and the steamed latte had a nice refreshing taste. My rating is 9 out of 10.\n\nThe drip coffee V60 hot was brewed with Ethiopia Guji coffee beans with tasting notes of papaya, dried apricots, and apple. It's the best coffee, especially when paired with a premium assortment of fine chocolates. My rating is 10 out of 10.\n\nThe dessert of the day was the creamy classic cake, while the nixed berries and red currant toppings and the graham crackers base were nice and tasty the cheese/cake wasn't so smooth and moist (a tad dry for my palate). My rating is 8 out of 10.\n\nThe assorted fine chocolates (crepe dulcey, almond praline with rice crispy, mini chocolate monarch, pecan caramel chocolate, mini chocolate salted caramel) was so yummylicious! My rating is 10 out of 10.\n\nOverall rating is 9 out of 10.\n\n@Mr. Qasim and Mr. Abdulrahman, thanks for hosting me today.\n\nAnother unforgettable and memorable experience in my food journey in search of the best cafes, bakeries, and restaurants.",

A beautiful morning, as the city wakes up, I am on the road looking for my next destination.\n\nGood morning, Riyadh, It is 6:35 AM, i am at Elixir Bunn, and after chatting with Mr. Zuhair, I have the go-ahead to take pictures and videos for the review.\n\nJust a quick background story on the Café as per their official website:\n\"Our story began with the search for the best way to compose distinct flavors from Latin, African, and other sources of coffee across the world, with 10,000 taste buds in every sip. We believe that drinking coffee is one of the source of happiness and energy for millions of coffee tasters in Saudi Arabia. And for our interest in continuing and enhancing this experience from the pioneers of the coffee elixir, we sought to import the finest types of coffee in the world.\"\n\nWow! The Café has beautiful interiors and very spacious and well arranged seating. There is another spacious  room with a nice center table that can seat 8 people. The Café has a cool chic ambiance. Once the record player is fixed, there are over a hundred records to choose your favorite songs.\n\nNow, for some real action with Yazeed Alhumaidi, the expert barista with over 4 plus years of experience.\n\nI get a freshly brewed hot cup of coffee. Elixir Bunn branded Kitropiki coffee beans from Uganda 🇺🇬 Yazeed is using Kalita equipment to make the drip coffee.\n\nCoffee Equipment background:\n\"Kalita is a family-owned Japanese company, first established at Nihonbashi, Tokyo in 1958. The company has been making coffee equipment for a few decades now, turning into one of the most prolific companies in the coffee products business sector.\"\n\nKitropiki is a single origin coffee from the Rwenzori Mountains, Kasese District, Western Uganda, grown at 1900 meters above sea level. Taste: berries, tea hint, tropical fruits.\n\nMy rating is 11 out of 10.\n\nYazeed recommends Tiramisu dessert to compliment this exquisite coffee. The Tiramisu is made in-house at Elixir Bunn and has a very nice texture and the right amount of sweetness, chocolate, and coffee. This is a seriously delicious rating, is 8 out of 10.\n\nAs per Mr. Edward Yung (customer), he rates Elixir Bunn with a solid 8 out of 10.\n\nMy overall rating is 9.5 out of 10.\n\n@Zuhair and Yazeed, thanks for hosting me today.\n\nAnother unforgettable and memorable chapter in my food journey....",

Spent about 5 hours, in and out. 4 areas for children: enigmatic forrest, painted monsters and super heroes , soft ball play area, mirror illusion maze. Each area is not very big but okay for imaginative play. My grandson revisited each area 4 times, he liked the maze and soft ball the most. Staff were very friendly, especially Fatima and Hussain. They made the day more enjoyable and fun. Thank you. Overall for Riyadh it was value for money.",

It is magnificent and intriguing to see the human reconstruction of Hinat, the first ever of a Nabatean resident. The entire reconstruction process is shared along with tomb # 117 where her skeleton was discovered. \nThereafter, we visited the unfinished tomb of Lihyan son Kuza, often referred to as Madain Saleh. From there to Jebal AlAhmar (Red Mountain) where tomb # 117 is located. \nThis was followed by Jebel Ithlib and the Diwan, which is superb, somewhat like a movie set with picturesque mountains that are incredible. Simply beautiful. \nJebal Banat (Mountain of the Women) that is extraordinary, with permission to enter tomb # 26 to witness how the ancient Nabatean were buried. I was silent for much of the trip as one becomes speechless at the breathtaking views.\n\nThe next day was Jebal Khuraibah to see the tombs and excavations of Dadan & Lihyan civilizations that occured before the Nabatean. The lion tombs were resplendent and towering. Then we went across to Jebal Ikmah to view the petroglyphs that is the anciet rock art in the ancient Aramaic language that was before Arabic. It's referred to as the open air library. Our visit to AlUla Old Town was magnificent especially the view from the top of the castle. In summary, these sites are never enough viewing it only once, and therefore repeated visits are enriching and expansive to knowledge of how the Nabatean lived on the ancient Incense Road. It's no wonder that it is a recognized UNESCO World Heritage site.",

So as we were heading back to the capital city, we were discussing the discomforts of what took place in that valley and the plight’s silver lining. This was when the place called “Diriyah” surfaced. Thank heavens, all of us, especially Chauffer Sai, were still up for a rebound.\n\nIn my homeland, we usually head up to the high lands for a breath of fresh air but not here in Riyadh. Heading down to the low-lying areas like this Wadi Hanifah coulee is the theme.\n\nYes, we did not make it to the Edge of the World but setting foot on this historical site is also an experience of a lifetime. For a lover of history, it is always an opportunity to get a feel of an old place’s historical thread because it provides an understanding of how the place and its landscape have developed over time. How saddening it would be if we only get to learn by books more so if this were the only way to see them.\n\nWadi Hanifah is a great rebound and a hideaway for the city dwellers of Riyadh..",

Saudi Arabia Tours helped me put together an itinerary that met my interests and enabled me to experience the country. I spent a few days in Riyadh, including a fantastic trip to the Edge of the World. Then i flew across the country to Jeddah and drove to Taif and Abha. The guides drove safely and were very accommodating — when we were unable to visit sites on the agenda due to closures, we worked together to come up with alternatives. We also stopped at random places on the road, like a camel milk market and a honey farm. Tourism in Saudi Arabia is in its infancy, so flexibility and an adventurous spirit are necessary. I was satisfied with my choice of 3-star hotels, which were pretty good for that part of the world and had decent breakfast buffets. I would encourage travelers to do their own research and visit places of interest that might not be on the set itineraries. Also, a highlight for me was meeting the extremely welcoming Saudi people, which i did on my own in the evenings. On the whole, i was happy with the services of Saudi Arabia Tours and had a wonderful time on my trip.",

It's the best one in the city because it's not too crowded, so you can have a fun time without feeling overwhelmed. There aren't too many restaurants, but you still have a few options to choose from.\n\nOne thing I really liked about Thaghr Plaza is that it's not too busy, so it's nice and peaceful. They also have a big parking lot, which makes it easy to find a spot for your car.\n\nI definitely recommend going to Thaghr Plaza, especially if you want to have a good time with your family.",

    "text": "We visited from Japan on a local guided tour. The Al Dwaihra Mosque is located in the Al Bujairi district of Ad Diriyah, known as the \"Pearl of Saudi Arabia\". It is located about 20km northwest of the centre of Riad. A narrow river flows through the valley called Wadi Hanifah, and on the other side is the Al Turaif district, a world heritage site with Salwa Palace, the first capital of the Saud dynasty.\nThe riverbank is planted with many date palms and is green, making it a park where you can have a picnic. The nearby sun-dried mud brick building has been beautifully restored, and the ground is covered with stone tiles, making it completely dusty. The mosque is a narrow alley.\n\nWhen we visited, it was quiet and it was a weekday and there was no one there. In Saudi Arabia, event periods are set for each tourist destination, and Diriyah Season is from November to December (last time 22 Nov 2019 - 21 Dec 2019), so you can see ruins and facilities that are not normally open to the public. This is the best time to visit this area as you can. We visited near the end of Al Ula's Winter at Tantora Season 2 (19 Dec 2019 - 7 Mar 2020), so it was not an event time in Diriyah, and the surrounding area was blocked due to the preparations for the classic car event. There are also.\nThere are no easy-to-understand signs in the park or at the entrance to the mosque, so if you don't understand Arabic, it would be difficult to visit Al Dwaihra Mosque without a guide. The staff member let me in and we toured the room through the glass.\n\nSunni religious scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was welcomed by Ibn Saud of Diliah in 1744 and spread his teachings. It is unknown when the Al Dwaihra Mosque was built, but it is quite old. The architectural styles of 10 historical mosques in Saudi Arabia are explained in the Najdi Style and the Abdullatif Al Fozan Award \"Historical Mosques in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Investigating Architectural Styles Typology.\" Of the 10, we also visited Mimar Mosque, Umar Ibn Al Khattab Mosque and Shafe'i Mosques on this trip, and we were pleased to see some of the most representative mosques in a short period of time. Furthermore, the Abdullatif Al Fozan Award website includes Mosqpedia, which covers mosque architecture information, and if you search for \"Dwaihra\", you can see photos and drawings, making it a very valuable site for architecture lovers.\n\nAlso, while looking for photos before the mosque's restoration, information about Al Bujairi is known as \"Al-Bujairi...Heart of the Call\" in Publications on the Royal Commission for Riyadh City (RCRC) website. There is a 134-page publication covering the book, featuring photos of the mosque taken in the 1960s by Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy, along with photos after the restoration. There are also photos that allow you to see the bricks and the ceiling after the restoration, and illustrations inspired by the time. The mosque name is listed as \"Al Dhuwayhirah mosque\". The RCRC website has a very comprehensive resource on Riyadh, and there are still few publications on Saudi Arabia, so it is very helpful. By the way, there are Arabic and English versions.\n\nUntil I saw the photos before the restoration of the mosque, I thought that the restoration of the Saudi Arabian ruins would be too clean and not seem to have been aged, but since the construction method is a simple method based on sun-dried mud bricks, the area has deteriorated. I was able to understand that once I fixed it and repaired it to a passable state, the only way to fix it in such a way is to fix it neatly. To prevent such misunderstandings, it is easy to understand if you post photos of the site before the repair is displayed.",

You can do as much or as little of the hike as you can manage.  There's no pressure at all to go marching off in to the distance.  The dinner at the end of the evening was delicious.  The guys took such good care of us all.  At the end of the evening everything was packed away (carpets, chairs, majlis seats etc) and stashed into the vehicles with expert precisions.  All litter was accounted for and taken away with us.  We took nothing but photos and memories from this wonderful evening, and left nothing but footprints.  10/10.  Thank you Riyadh Hiking!",

After the ride there was a chance to sit on a camel for a short stroll guided by a staff member with a rope. On way back we stopped for a drink at Dunkin Donuts paid for us. Overall very good. Some potential improvements - optional helmet on the bikes, tidier dunes - lots of litter, a longer camel ride option over the dunes and finally a better local coffee shop - Dunkin is not good coffee!

    "text": "*3/5 stars*\n\nI recently visited this hotel and had a mixed experience. The atmosphere and ambience were pleasant and welcoming, and the service was good. However, the rates were quite high, which I felt was not entirely justified by the quality of food.\n\nI ordered the chicken jalfrezi and shahi daal, both of which were unfortunately very average in taste. The dishes lacked a wow factor and were quite normal, which was disappointing considering the high prices.\n\nOverall, while the hotel's atmosphere and service were good, the high rates and average food quality left me feeling slightly underwhelmed. Perhaps with a few improvements in the culinary department, this hotel could live up to its full potential.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n- Good atmosphere and ambience\n- Friendly and efficient service\n- Clean and comfortable surroundings\n\n*Cons:*\n\n- High rates\n- Average food quality\n- Limited value for money\n\n*Recommendation:*\n\nThis hotel has potential, but needs to work on its food quality and pricing strategy to justify the high rates. If you're looking for a comfortable stay and don't mind average food, this might be a decent option. However, if you're a foodie or on a budget, you might want to explore other options.",

The desserts I recommend are no less than normal, and the coffee is not worth it and it does not taste sweet.\nIn general, if they listen to customers and improve the place based on what they ask for, it will be the best place.",

The kids had a blast playing in the indoor play area, and the food was surprisingly good.\n\nA special thanks to Mr. Mohammad, Mr. Denis, and Miss Layla for their excellent service and for making Eleen's birthday so special. They were incredibly friendly, attentive, and went above and beyond to ensure everyone had a great time.\n\nHighly recommend Chuck E",

Why are they not renovating and repairing it and bringing new games and exclusive ideas? Why is it neglected? Even the floors are not even. The place is a watery swamp and even has the smell of rot. The workers are forbidden to work, but the place is disgusting. In an unnatural way\nThere is an alternative to it that is newer and close to it, but I said we would try a new place and I regretted it. In general, the entry was from 20 Han 3. We paid 60, and children under two years are free. The sofas are old, I don’t know from what age they even have ants 🐜 and are stained and torn. I will add pictures for you. It is impossible for me to think, if just thinking, that I would go there after that. There is a booth. Fatih sells juices, coffee, tea, and swimwear",

    "text": "It lacks cleanliness and attention and is in ruins. Even the old one is being renewed. I am surprised that it is a place that is supposed to be fun for children in this way. Why are they not renovating and repairing it and bringing new games and exclusive ideas? Why is it neglected? Even the floors are not even. The place is a watery swamp and even has the smell of rot. The workers are forbidden to work, but the place is disgusting. In an unnatural way\nThere is an alternative to it that is newer and close to it, but I said we would try a new place and I regretted it. In general, the entry was from 20 Han 3. We paid 60, and children under two years are free. The sofas are old, I don’t know from what age they even have ants 🐜 and are stained and torn. I will add pictures for you. It is impossible for me to think, if just thinking, that I would go there after that. There is a booth. Fatih sells juices, coffee, tea, and swimwear",

    "text": "I came from Riyadh for tourism as well. I like to practice my daily hobby, which is walking after the dawn prayer\nThe park is beautiful, but uncomfortable, not safe for children, and not clean.\n\nThe sidewalk is too small for walking.\nWater sprinklers fill the sidewalk with water, and they may also get wet due to their proximity to the sidewalk while walking.\nThe chairs are poorly located and take up a lot of space on the sidewalk designated for walking.\nThe location of the castings is very, very, very bad.\nThe sidewalk has a landing.\nThe palm tree takes up part of the sidewalk.\nThe place is full of dead cockroaches and flies.\n\nAnd now the most dangerous thing!!!\nPower transformers in the park and water touching them may cause, God forbid, fatal injuries.\nEspecially children, they cannot read and do not understand how dangerous it is. They may play around it and it may cause injury to them.\n\nIf I come with children, I will not choose this park, which harms the beauty and splendor of the Tabuk region, especially since Tabuk is a tourist destination for everyone.\n\nI hope they will re-maintain and control the park and make it safe and comfortable for everyone, because this is the first time I have seen a park this bad and dangerous at the same time.",

The road up to Bjeddah though unpaved is in good condition. The whole eastern area is a desert with unconnected rocky areas. Following the existing tire tracks or simply moving among the rocks you can drive in the whole area if you have a 4x4 and GPS. This area is, with certain differences, the southward continuation of Jordan's famous Wadi Rum. The bottom of the ground on which the car is moving does not have significant sandy areas (we have not deflated the tires). Moving in these desert areas among the rocks you can take excellent photographs in which the warm colors of the desert and rocks are clearly highlighted against the background of the blue sky. We have not observed wildlife (apart from some rare footprints in the sand), but we have met two shepherds with their flocks of goats and a few one-humped camels. Very interesting.",

    "text": "The first and last experience. We came from a long distance and reserved the same table with our names. There was only one cooperative waiter. The second waiter came and a foreign manager was puffing and saying (what is left of your first hour) which in fact only had a quarter of an hour left. I explained our situation to him and we traveled a long way. We have many reservations with our names on the same table. The reservations you are talking about are our reservations. It was bad, bad. I told him what should we do? He said yes, go out and left. When one of the waiters cooperated and we sat down, the one who served the food was puffing and the table lights were off. The order came down after 25 minutes. That means you took half of our time. Why are your conditions strict? If half of my time is taken because of your poor service, no manager, no service, no quality. Frankly, I came based on my reputation, but unfortunately it is not true. If the lights are broken and your customers have no respect or presentation. Bad in every sense of the word, except for the cramped place and the table is at the door. An experience that will not be repeated. My evaluation is in the mains.",

There are different rates  for different boats and yachts. You can choose your timings, we went from 9am to 1pm.\nWe were a group of 10 people and opted for this boat in frame and it costed us total sr1000 + sr130 (fruit basket) for 4 hours. \n\nKeep exploring for more boats as you can get cheaper ones too, we got to know about the cheaper ones after we had booked and did the advance payment. So keep contacting different boat guides. \n\nActivities-🚤\n•If you're lucky then you can get to see dolphins, turtles and fish. Unfortunately we couldn't see dolphins or turtles.🐬🐢🐠\nTip- carry khubs or roti so that seagulls can come closer to you. \n\n• Our boat anchored  into the middle of the sea where there was shallow water and we stayed there for around 2 hours. It was definitely the best experience from the whole boat ride. Swimming, floating and relaxing and clicking pictures. All you could see was crystal clear water and beautiful shades of blue around till far. \n😍\n• Fishing- none of us were interested in it so we didn't do fishing. 🐠\n\nDefinitely a mesmerising experience for sea lovers.❤❤❤",
